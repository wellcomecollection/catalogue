# Stemming

To control for variation in queries, prefixes and suffixes are stripped so that only the root word is matched against fields (eg removal of endings “ly,” “ed” and “ing.”)


# Stripping

To control for variation in use of punctuation in queries (eg “gray's anatomy,” vs “grays anatomy”), all punctuation is removed before matching.
