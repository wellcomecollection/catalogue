  //
  //    You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that
  //    corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use
  //
  // This error can be reproduced by running "CREATE DATABASE <name>" inside
  // the Docker image.  It's not clear what features of the name cause this
  // error to occur, but so far we've only seen it in database names that
  // include numbers.  We're guessing some arrangement of numbers causes the
  // issue; for now we just use letters to try to work around this issue.

  // The Oracle docs are not enlightening in this regard:
